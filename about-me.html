              I’ve heard that imagination combined with knowledge is one of the
              most powerful tools in a person’s arsenal. Some even call it
              magic. So, my twenty-one-year-old self, Nijaz Andelić, wants to
              become the best and most creative wizard possible.

          I am a Computer Science student at the Sarajevo School of Science and
          Technology. I first encountered Lego bricks at the age of five, which
          means I have around
          <span class="subheading subheading--rose subheading--upper"
            >15 years of experience in problem-solving</span

          through these Lego bricks and the influence of an older friend who is
          now a senior software engineer.

              My cousins often teased me by turning off my joystick while they

              During elementary school, I delved deeper into computers through
              games (P.S. I played all the good games at my software engineering
              friend’s house because I had a “junk” computer).

              However, that junk computer had a huge impact on my career path.
              Playing Minecraft Hunger Games, experiencing game lag during
              fights was not pleasant and made me search “How to speed up
              Minecraft” for the first time. This led to new problems like
              needing more RAM, GPU… But, what is RAM? And so I became a googler
              (What is RAM? How to get more RAM without buying parts? FPS?
              GPU?...). That’s where my problem-solving and googling skills
              began. Long story short, one of my hobbies today is assembling
              computers and computer configurations.

                I remember well that in the second grade of high school, while
                typing double nested loops, I said these loops would never be
                useful for programming because it’s Pascal… Ah, the good old
                days… And so, officially, in the summer of 2019, I wrote my
                first independent line of code—believe it or not—in Python. A
                language I still don’t like today (I’m more of a Java guy, or
                maybe because Python it’s a good rival to my JavaScript).

                I quickly moved away from Python and started a career in Web
                Development. Despite many breaks, mistakes, failures, and
                moments of doubt, I managed to train my brain to work when it’s
                hardest… Of course, this wouldn’t be possible if I didn’t love
                programming.

                So, I firmly say, programming is Me, and I am a programmer. I
                love engineering and optimization, so I even pretend to be
                Dijkstra in my head, finding the shortest possible routes
                (calculating constraints by traffic lights) to get somewhere the
                fastest—I consider it algorithm practice.
